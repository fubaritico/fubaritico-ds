## Completed

Put here the completed tasks and plans to avoid cluttering the context window.

### 2026-06-07 — CI + git remote

- **git remote created**: `origin` = https://github.com/fubaritico/fubaritico-ds (public, org `fubaritico`), `main` pushed. Needed `gh auth refresh -s workflow` + `gh auth setup-git`.
- **CI built** (`.github/`): composite `setup` action → `ci.yml` orchestrates `validate` (lint/type-check/test) → `build` (`build:packages`, **stencil excluded** until its build is green) → `sonarqube` (self-skips without `SONAR_TOKEN`) → `quality-gate`. **Green on first run.**
- Deferred CI stubs (`e2e`, `pa11y`, `deploy-storybook`) as `workflow_dispatch`-only.
- GitHub Actions bumped to Node 24 majors (`pnpm/action-setup@v6`, `upload-artifact@v6`, `sonarqube-scan-action@v7`).
- SonarCloud project initialized (key `fubaritico-ds`, org `fubaritico`); `sonar-init` ran green; sonar now active in CI.
- `nx.json`: `lint`/`coverage` added to `targetDefaults` (`dependsOn: ['^build']`). Coverage v8 + lcov on shared/reference/stencil.

### 2026-06-08/09 — White-label native-CSS pivot + Badge spike

- **New `packages/styles`** (`@fubaritico-ds/styles`, CSS-only): portable native **BEM skin** in `@layer ui.components`, **component-scoped `--ui-*` variables** for override, PostCSS bundle (import+nested+autoprefixer+minify) → `dist/styles.css`. peerDep on tokens.
- **tokens**: primary amber → **Material UI blue** (`#1976d2`, new `blue` primitive) — white-label proof.
- **Badge migrated off Tailwind** to BEM + **CVA** (`badgeVariants`), `extends ComponentProps<'span'>`; tests rewritten in BEM (5-level); static demo harness (`packages/styles/demo/index.html`).
- **`/review` hardened**: added 7th subagent **`review-styles`** (CSS/BEM rules) + `*.css` scope; it immediately caught real CSS issues the TS-only review had missed (tokenized paddings, line-height var, md emits no class).
- Added BEM skills (`bem-structure`, ` audit-style`); cleaned `settings.local.json` (removed obsolete RN/Expo skills + context7); refined `CLAUDE.md` rules (plans in `files/plans/`, challenge-by-default, push allowed).
- All green: `type-check && lint && test && build:packages`. Plan: `files/plans/badge-spike-native-css.md`.
- **Decision locked**: `packages/reference` is a **guide/sandbox, NOT a deliverable** (may be deleted at the end). Real deliverables = framework packages consuming `@fubaritico-ds/{tokens,styles}`.
